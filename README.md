# Hospitality-Data-Analysis-And-BI-Dashboard
## **📌 Overview**
This Power BI project analyzes **hotel performance data** from the Atliq Group, covering multiple properties across cities in India. The interactive dashboard provides data-driven insights into **revenue trends, occupancy rates, pricing strategies, and cancellations**, helping optimize business decision-making and revenue management.

## **📂 DataSet**
- **Schema**: Structured using a **star schema** with **two fact tables** and **three dimension tables**.
- **Business Context**: Evaluates **occupancy rates, pricing models, and revenue optimization strategies** for a hotel chain.

## **🔹 Key Features**
✔ **Data Model:** Developed a **star schema** for efficient data processing.  
✔ **KPI Dashboard:** Tracked key metrics such as **Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy%, DSRN, and Realization%.**  
✔ **Dynamic Insights:** Implemented **interactive filters, slicers, and tooltips** for deeper trend analysis.  
✔ **Pricing Strategy Analysis:** Identified **flat ADR trends** and proposed a **dynamic pricing model**.  
✔ **Occupancy & Cancellation Analysis:** Found hotels with **low occupancy rates and high cancellation percentages**.  
✔ **Business Recommendations:** Suggested **weekday/weekend pricing models** and **discount strategies for direct bookings**.  

## **📊 Business Insights & Recommendations**
🔹 Hotels were **not using demand-based pricing**, leading to **flat ADR trends**.  
🔹 Implementing a **weekday/weekend pricing model** could **increase revenue**.  
🔹 **Atliq Grands Bangalore & Atliq Seasons Mumbai** had the **lowest occupancy%, highest cancellation%, and lowest average rating**, indicating a potential issue with 
  pricing or service quality.  
🔹 **Platform-based discounting strategies** were suggested to optimize direct bookings **without affecting third-party platform rankings** (e.g., MakeMyTrip, Agoda).
